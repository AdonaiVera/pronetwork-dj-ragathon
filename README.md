# AGENTIC RAG-A-THON - Hackathon Project ðŸš€

## Inspiration
Exceptional networkers at tech events typically aim to meet around 30 people, hoping to make 10 high-quality connections in a few hours. For events like SF Tech Week, this means interacting with less than 20% of the attendees. Most people end up manually sorting through the attendee list and reaching out on LinkedIn, which is time-consuming. We wanted to change that by enabling users to better connect with the right people at events.

Inspired by **Generative Agents**, introduced by Stanfordâ€™s **Park, Joon Sung, et al.** in 2023 ([research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)), we created a system to simulate interactions between event attendees and uncover key details that could spark deeper connectionsâ€”giving users an edge before meeting in person.

## What It Does
**ProNetwork DJ** helps you find and connect with the most relevant people at an event by using advanced algorithms and simulations. Here's how it works:

- **Input**: You provide a description of the type of people youâ€™re looking to meet.
- **Profile Matching**: The system narrows down the list of event attendees to relevant profiles.
- **Agent Simulation**: Digital clones of both you and the relevant profiles are created.
- **Simulated Conversations**: Conversations are simulated between your digital clone and the matches, extracting insights from these interactions.
- **Recommendations**: The system provides key talking points for when you meet these people at the event.

## How We Built It

- **Data Collection**:
  - Scraped the Luma app for attendee lists.
  - Gathered LinkedIn profiles to get comprehensive user data.

- **Data Processing**:
  - Created digital user profiles using an **agent-based approach**.
  - Vectorized the data with **LlamaIndex** and stored it in a **MongoDB** vector database.

- **Matching Algorithm**:
  - Implemented **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
  - Used **cosine similarity** to identify the top three matches based on user preferences.

- **Interaction Simulation**:
  - Developed a multi-agent system (user agent, observation agent, reflection agent, planning agent, conversation agent).
  - Simulated conversations between the user agent and the match agents.
  - Extracted key insights and areas of focus for real-life meetings.

- **Additional Features**:
  - Built a pipeline to fetch and store more data in the vector database using **Pinecone**.

## Challenges We Faced
Implementing a simplified generative agent memory system proved to be more challenging than expected. This resulted in conversations between agents lacking the level of detail we hoped for. To overcome this temporarily, we injected targeted prompts and discussion topics to ensure we could still generate useful insights. Future iterations and access to more detailed data will improve the system.

## Accomplishments Weâ€™re Proud Of
- Weâ€™re proud of rethinking the networking process by using **simulation** to explore deeper connections.
- Building such an exciting project with a great team during the hackathon has been a major highlight.

## What We Learned
- **LlamaIndex** is a game-changer for vectorizing and processing data.
- We learned the importance of moving fast, iterating quickly, and ensuring simulated interactions are meaningful.

## Whatâ€™s Next for ProNetwork DJ
- We aim to run more simulations to create parallel "what could happen" scenarios for networking events.
- Weâ€™re also interested in exploring the potential of using simulations in **sales**, to improve lead generation and matching.
- We plan to expand our data scraping efforts to include sources like **Google Scholar**, **news articles**, and other databases to create richer user profiles.
